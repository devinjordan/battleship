## Info

Capstone Javascript project in The Odin Project curriculum.

I definitely think that a lot of the codebase could have been condensed. Things were going great with the Test Driven Development, but once I got into DOM manipulation I definitely reworked some of the problems unnecessarily which led to buggy code that I had to go back and refactor (read: delete).

I absolutely adore TDD for a project like this. It gives it a very incremental approach in which I felt satisfied that I was moving forward as I either came up with or successfully completed each test.

Lastly, this project was done over the course of about three months. Perhaps this is why I did so much unnecessary rework. Life happens and I had a child and a career transition. I'm happy to get this one completed and move on to learn more.

## Future Additions

I'd like to revisit this to add these in the following order:

- Better status updates.
- A replay button on the final modal.
- Logic from the AI where it can follow hits to the conclusion of sinking a ship
- Additional shot types, such as an "air strike" where either combatant may select a row to shoot in, or a "depth charge" (or something like that) where a combatant can attack a cell and all surrounding cells.
- Improved UI. The point of this project was to work on JS skills, so I kep the UI pretty simple.
